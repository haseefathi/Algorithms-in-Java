# Deques and Randomized Queues
## Deques
A double-ended queue or deque (pronounced “deck”) is a generalization of a stack and a queue that supports adding and removing items from either the front or the back of the data structure. 
## Randomized queue
A randomized queue is similar to a stack or queue, except that the item removed is chosen uniformly at random among items in the data structure.
## Permutation
This is the client program that takes an integer k as a command-line argument; reads a sequence of strings from standard input using StdIn.readString(); and prints exactly k of them, uniformly at random.
